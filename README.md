# Conquering Responsive Layouts

You know that feeling that you are guessing which CSS to write? I've always felt like that. I could take a [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) newbie or even Junior challenge and get by, but it used to feel like cheating. I didn't really know what was going on.

This free course from [Kevin](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) was very useful to go back, take it easy and solidify my CSS knowledge.

Of course there is still a lot to learn, but I'm more confident to keep going after solidying my fundamentals.

I even took the liberty to make some fun on mobile menu button. Now there is a animation on menu button.

The course can be found [here](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/). The live version of my solution to the challenge can be found [here](https://conquering-responsive-layouts-final-challenge.vercel.app).
